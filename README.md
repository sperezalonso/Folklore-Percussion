# Folklore Percussion

This project was created for my Bachelor's thesis. It is a virtual reality experience for the Oculus Rift, where the player can play a marimba prototype either in free mode or jamming along to a song. The project uses spatialized audio to create the impression of all instruments being played at different positions in the scene.
